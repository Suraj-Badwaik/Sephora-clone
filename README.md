<h1>Sephora-clone</h1>

<p>This repository contains a functional clone of the sephora website. The pages that we included here are the home page, the cart and checkout process pages, the login and signup pages, and all the navbar pages (the top black navbar). The brands page displays letters on the top and on clicking a letter, the page scrolls to the brands starting from that letter. For all the other pages, the displayed products on the pages can be added to cart, and it displays the total price, and allows you to place the order. The page also has a custom icon in the tab that we added.<p>

<h2>Project brief:</h2>

Our task was to make a functional clone of the Sephora website. Sephora is a French company founded by Dominique Mandonnaud in 1969. They produce and sell luxury beauty products, like cosmetics, skincare, bodycare, perfume, nail colours, and hair care. The brand features 340 subsidiary brands, along with its own; Sephora collection.

The home page is the main landing page that users can interact with. It features a top and bottom navigation bar, as well as all the content in the body. The top navbar is fully responsive.

The process of creating an account, and logging into the website is the same as in the original website, where credentials are entered and verified to login. On logging in the user is redirected to the landing page.


In the nav bar, the brands page displays letters on the top and on clicking a letter, the page scrolls to the brands starting from that letter.

All the pages are functional, and every product in every page is written in the form of an array of objects which is then displayed in a grid on screen. This means whenever a product is clicked, it is added to the cart. The items on the cart page can then be paid for, with an alert displaying successful payment.
