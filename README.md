# Sephora-completed-clone

This repository contains a functional clone of the sephora website. The pages that we included here are the home page, the cart and checkout process pages, the login and signup pages, and all the navbar pages (the top black navbar). The brands page displays letters on the top and on clicking a letter, the page scrolls to the brands starting from that letter. For all the other pages, the displayed products on the pages can be added to cart, and it displays the total price, and allows you to place the order. The page also has a custom icon in the tab that we added.
